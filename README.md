# Abstraction

I'm tinkering with GenAI in my homelab cluster and wasn't finding a lot of examples or documentation related to deploying this stuff to Kubernetes.  I've stood up this repo as a resource incase you find yourself in the same situation, and want to yank some of the learning curve out of GenAI Kubernetes deployments.
